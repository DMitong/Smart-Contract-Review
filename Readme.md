<h2 id="dsds"> INTRODUCTION </h2>

### <h3 id="Introduction"> 1. Introduction <h3>

The smart contract under review, `RealmFacet.sol`, is a crucial component of the Aavegotchi Realm Diamond, operating within the framework of the EIP-2535 standard. As a facet of this diamond, it manages key functionalities of the 'Gotchiverse' metaverse, specifically those related to the creation and administration of land parcels and installations in the Realm. The contract's structure and functionalities, including its use of modifiers and event emissions, are pivotal to understanding its role within the broader Aavegotchi ecosystem.

### <h3 id="Ppc"> 5. Notice on Review <h3>

The main Aavegotchi `RealmFacet.sol` codebase can be found at this [link](https://github.com/aavegotchi/aavegotchi-realm-diamond/blob/master/contracts/RealmDiamond/facets/RealmFacet.sol).

And as Aavegotchi is a progressive company, the facets are updated frequently, so the version of the code base that I reviewed as at 18th October, 2023 is added to this repository at `./Code Base/RealmFacet.sol;`
